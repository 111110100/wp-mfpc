# MemBlaze Full Page Cache for WordPress

## Introduction

This system provides a robust full-page caching mechanism for WordPress sites using Memcached, significantly improving performance and reducing server load. It consists of two main components:

1.  **`memblaze-full-page-cache-config.php`**: A WordPress plugin that provides an admin interface to configure the caching behavior, Memcached server(s), cache expiration rules, and generates necessary configuration files.
2.  **`index-cached.php`**: A PHP front-controller script that sits in your WordPress root directory. It intercepts requests, attempts to serve pages from Memcached, or, if a page isn't cached or the cache is bypassed, it loads WordPress to generate the page and then stores it in Memcached for subsequent requests.

## Features

*   **Memcached Integration**: Leverages the speed and efficiency of Memcached for storing full HTML pages.
*   **Configurable Cache Times**: Set a default cache expiration time and define specific cache durations for different URL paths (e.g., `/blog/`, `/category/`).
*   **Multiple Server Support**: Configure one or more Memcached servers (TCP/IP or Unix sockets).
*   **Automatic Cache Purging**:
    *   Purges cache for individual posts/pages and the homepage when content is saved, updated, or deleted.
    *   **Bulk Actions**: Purge cache for multiple posts directly from the WordPress post list.
    *   **Purge Method**: Choose between precise purging of specific pages or flushing the entire cache on updates.
*   **Cache Pre-loading (Warmup)**:
    *   **On Save**: Automatically visits the post and homepage after purging to regenerate the cache.
    *   **Scheduled**: Automatically pre-cache a specified number of recent posts hourly.
    *   **WP-CLI**: Command to manually warm up the cache.
*   **Lazy Load (Experimental)**: Automatically adds `loading="lazy"` attributes to images and iframes to improve Core Web Vitals.
*   **Cookie-Based Cache Bypass**: Define a list of cookie name prefixes. If a visitor has any of these cookies, the cache will be bypassed for them, ensuring dynamic content for logged-in users or users with specific session cookies (e.g., e-commerce carts).
*   **Admin Interface & Stats**:
    *   **Dashboard Stats**: View server statistics.
    *   **Admin Bar**: See cache status of the current page and purge it instantly.
*   **Debug Mode**: Optional debug comments in the HTML output showing cache status and generation time.
*   **Nginx Configuration Generation**: The plugin generates a sample Nginx configuration snippet to help direct requests to `index-cached.php`.
*   **Server Status Check**: Test connectivity to your Memcached servers directly from the plugin settings page.
*   **Enterprise Ready**:
    *   **Environment Configuration**: Support for defining settings via `wp-config.php` constants for immutable deployments.
    *   **WP-CLI Support**: Manage cache and check status via command line.
    *   **Site Health Integration**: Built-in checks for Memcached connectivity.
    *   **Emergency Bypass**: Instantly disable caching via a file trigger.

## How it Works

1.  **Nginx Request Handling**: The web server (Nginx) is configured to first check for static files. If a static file is not found and the request is for a PHP page, Nginx is configured to pass the request to `index-cached.php` instead of the standard `index.php`.
2.  **`index-cached.php` Interception**:
    *   Reads its configuration from `wp-content/memcached-fp-config.php` (generated by the plugin).
    *   Checks if the current visitor has any cookies that match the "bypass cookies" list. If so, it proceeds to generate a fresh page without checking or storing to cache.
    *   Determines the appropriate cache key based on the host and request URI.
    *   Determines the cache expiration time based on configured rules or the default.
    *   Attempts to fetch the page from Memcached using the cache key.
3.  **Cache Hit**: If the page is found in Memcached and is not expired, `index-cached.php` serves the cached HTML directly to the visitor and exits.
4.  **Cache Miss/Bypass**: If the page is not in Memcached, is expired, or the cache is bypassed:
    *   `index-cached.php` captures the output of WordPress generating the page.
    *   If caching is enabled for this request and not bypassed by a cookie, the generated HTML is stored in Memcached with the determined cache key and expiration time.
    *   The freshly generated HTML is served to the visitor.

## Setup and Installation

### Prerequisites

*   A WordPress installation.
*   Memcached server(s) installed and running.
*   The Memcached PECL extension for PHP installed and enabled.
*   Nginx web server (recommended, as the system is primarily designed for it).

### Step 1: Install Files

1.  **Plugin (`memblaze-full-page-cache-config.php`)**:
    *   Place the `memblaze-full-page-cache-config.php` file (and any associated files if it's part of a larger plugin structure, e.g., in a directory like `wp-content/plugins/memblaze-fullpage-cache-config/`) into your WordPress `wp-content/plugins/` directory.
    *   Activate the "Memcached Full Page Cache Config" plugin from the WordPress admin area.

2.  **Front Controller (`index-cached.php`)**:
    *   Place the `index-cached.php` file into the root directory of your WordPress installation (the same directory where `wp-config.php` and the main `index.php` are located).

### Step 2: Configure Nginx

You need to modify your Nginx server block configuration for your WordPress site to direct appropriate requests to `index-cached.php`.

1.  **Generate Nginx Config Snippet**:
    *   Go to "Settings" -> "Memcached Cache Config" in your WordPress admin.
    *   Configure your Memcached server(s) under the "Memcached Servers" section.
    *   Save the settings.
    *   The plugin will generate a file named `memcached_nginx.conf` in your `wp-content/` directory. This file contains a suggested Nginx `upstream` block and location rules.

2.  **Apply Nginx Configuration**:
    *   **Copy the `upstream` block** from `wp-content/memcached_nginx.conf` (e.g., `upstream memcached_servers { ... }`) and place it in your main `nginx.conf` file within the `http { ... }` block, or in a dedicated conf file included by `nginx.conf`.
    *   **Modify your site's server block**:
        The key is to change your `try_files` directive and the PHP processing block.
        A typical WordPress Nginx configuration might look like this:

        ```nginx
        server {
            listen 80;
            server_name example.com;
            root /var/www/html;

            index index.php index.html index.htm;

            location / {
                try_files $uri $uri/ /index.php?$args;
            }

            location ~ \.php$ {
                try_files $uri =404;
                fastcgi_split_path_info ^(.+\.php)(/.+)$;
                fastcgi_pass unix:/var/run/php/phpX.Y-fpm.sock; # Adjust to your PHP-FPM socket/address
                fastcgi_index index.php;
                include fastcgi_params;
                fastcgi_param SCRIPT_FILENAME $document_root$fastcgi_script_name;
                # ... other params
            }

            # ... other rules (static assets, security)
        }
        ```

        Copy the generated `memcached_upstream.conf` file into `/etc/nginx/conf.d`:

        ```bash
        cp /var/www/path/to/wordpress/wp-content/memcached_nginx.conf /etc/nginx/conf.d/
        ```

        You need to update `/etc/nginx/sites-enabled/default` (or if you're using virtual hosting, the relevant config site file) to include the generated `memblaze_nginx.conf` file:

        ```nginx
        server {
            listen 80;
            server_name example.com;
            root /var/www/html; # Your WordPress root

            location ~ \.php$ {
                include snippets/fastcgi_params;
                fastcgi_pass unix:/var/run/php/phpX.Y-fpm.sock; # Where X.Y is your PHP-FPM version
            }

            # MemBlaze
            include /var/www/path/to/wordpress/wp-config/memcached_nginx.conf;

        }
        ```
        **Note**: The Nginx configuration can be complex and site-specific. The example above is a guideline. The crucial part is that requests that would normally go to `index.php` should now go to `index-cached.php`. The `memcached_nginx.conf` generated by the plugin provides a more specific `location / { ... }` block that you might adapt.

3.  **Test Nginx Configuration**:
    `sudo nginx -t`

4.  **Reload Nginx**:
    `sudo systemctl reload nginx` or `sudo service nginx reload`

### Step 3: Configure the Plugin

1.  Navigate to "Settings" -> "Memcached Cache Config" in your WordPress admin dashboard.
2.  **General Settings**:
    *   **Enable Debug**: Check this to add HTML comments at the end of your pages showing cache status (hit/miss, bypass reason) and generation time. Useful for testing.
    *   **Default Cache Time**: Set the default expiration time in seconds for cached pages (e.g., `3600` for 1 hour).
    *   **Purge Cache on Actions**: Enable to automatically clear relevant caches when posts/pages are saved, updated, or deleted.
    *   **Pre-load Cache**: Automatically visit the post and homepage after purging to regenerate the cache.
    *   **Pre-cache Recent Posts**: Number of recent posts/pages to automatically pre-cache (warm up) hourly.
    *   **Lazy Load**: Enable experimental lazy loading for images and iframes.
    *   **Purge Method**: Select "Purge Specific Pages" (default) or "Flush Entire Cache".
    *   **Bypass Cache for Cookies**: Add cookie name prefixes (one per line) that should cause the cache to be bypassed. Defaults include common WordPress, WooCommerce, and other plugin cookies.
3.  **Memcached Servers**:
    *   Add your Memcached server(s) by specifying the Host (IP address, hostname, or path to Unix socket) and Port (e.g., `11211`, or `0` for Unix sockets).
    *   The "Status" column will attempt to connect and show if the server is reachable.
4.  **Cache Time Rules**:
    *   Define specific cache times for different URL paths.
    *   **Path**: The URI path prefix (e.g., `/blog/`, `/products/category/`).
    *   **Time in Seconds**: Cache duration for matching paths. `0` means do not cache.
    *   Rules are matched in the order they appear. The first matching rule applies.
5.  **Content Type Rules**:
    *   Define specific Content-Types for URI paths. Useful for API endpoints or feeds. These rules override the default text/html.
    *   **URI Path Contains**: URI to match
    *   **Content Type**: The assigned content type for this URI path.
    *   **Actions**: Option to delete an entry
6.  **Save Settings**: Click "Save Settings". This will:
    *   Save your settings to the WordPress database.
    *   Generate/update `wp-content/memcached-fp-config.php` (read by `index-cached.php`).
    *   Generate/update `wp-content/memcached_nginx.conf` (for your reference).

    *   Generate/update `wp-content/memcached_nginx.conf` (for your reference).

### Step 4: Enterprise Configuration (Optional)

For enterprise environments, you can configure the plugin using constants in `wp-config.php`. This overrides database settings.

```php
define( 'WP_MFPC_DEBUG', true );
define( 'WP_MFPC_DEFAULT_CACHE_TIME', 3600 );
define( 'WP_MFPC_SERVERS', [
    [ 'host' => '127.0.0.1', 'port' => '11211' ],
] );
define( 'WP_MFPC_RULES', [
    [ 'path' => '/', 'time' => 600 ],
] );
define( 'WP_MFPC_BYPASS_COOKIES', [
    'wordpress_logged_in_',
    'woocommerce_items_in_cart',
] );
```

### Step 5: WP-CLI Usage

The plugin supports WP-CLI commands:

*   `wp mfpc flush <all|post|page> [<id>]`: Flush all Memcached servers or specific items.
*   `wp mfpc status`: Check connection status of servers.
*   `wp mfpc warmup [<count>]`: Pre-cache recent posts/pages.
*   `wp mfpc generate-nginx`: Regenerate Nginx config file.

### Step 6: Emergency Bypass

To instantly disable the cache (e.g., during an incident), create a file named `.mfpc-bypass` in your WordPress root directory.

```bash
touch .mfpc-bypass
```

### Step 7: Test

1.  Open your website in a browser where you are not logged in (e.g., incognito mode).
2.  View the page source. If debug is enabled, you should see a comment like:
    `<!-- Page generated (cache miss) in X.XXXXXX seconds. | Cache TTL: YYYY seconds -->`
3.  Refresh the page. You should now see:
    `<!-- Page retrieved (cache hit) from nginx/memcached -->`
4.  Log in to WordPress. Visit a page. You should see a bypass message if your login cookies are in the bypass list:
    `<!-- Page generated (cache bypassed by cookie) in X.XXXXXX seconds. | Cache Bypassed by Cookie -->`
5.  Test cache purging by editing and saving a post. The cache for that post and the homepage should be cleared.

## Troubleshooting

*   **Permissions**: Ensure your web server has write permissions to the `wp-content/` directory to create `memcached-fp-config.php` and `memcached_nginx.conf`. If not, the plugin will display the content for you to create these files manually.
*   **Memcached PECL Extension**: Verify the Memcached PHP extension is installed and enabled (`php -m | grep memcached`).
*   **Memcached Server Running**: Ensure your Memcached service is running and accessible from your web server.
*   **Nginx Configuration**: Double-check your Nginx configuration. Incorrect `try_files` or `fastcgi_index` directives are common issues.
*   **Plugin Conflicts**: Other caching plugins or security plugins might interfere. Test with a minimal set of plugins if you encounter issues.
*   **Debug Output**: Use the plugin's debug mode and check your PHP error logs and Nginx error logs for clues.
